        <p class="text">About the Author</p>

        <p class="p-text">
            I am a BSIT student from STI. I aspire to become a DevOps or Cloud Engineer.
            I love studying new things aside from coding. I also have a love for old songs.
            In my free time, I enjoy reading books, playing video games, and exploring new technologies.
            I am passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement, and I am always looking 
            for new challenges to tackle.

            commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, 
            client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration,
